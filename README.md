# tmux-manager - unixify tmux as it should be. 

I made this little manager because typing full tmux commands was too much of a hassle and honestly felt stupid. At work I spend hours in the Unix terminal creating and switching sessions between projects and I needed tmux to work more like normal Unix commands. This started out as a tool just for me but I ended up using it way more than I expected— basically every hour for a whole year.

You can name the manager whatever you like. It’s called "lt" (launch tmux) but that’s just what I’ve used personally. You could just as well change it to whatever you prefer.

With "lt" you can:

- Quickly attach or create a session
- List sessions
- Rename or remove sessions
- Nuke everything (safely unless you’re feeling reckless)

I’m just confused why tmux is so funky in the first place. Like why not do this from the start?
